## Synopsis
In this exercise, I implemented regularized logistic regression and applied it to two
different datasets.

Files included in this exercise:
- ex2.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps  through the exercise
- ex2reg.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise
- ex2data1.txt - Training set for the first half of the exercise
- ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise
- mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features
- plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classifer's decision bound-ary
- [?] plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classification data
- [?] sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function
- [?] costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function
- [?] predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function
- [?] costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost

? indicates necessary exercies

Throughout the exercise, the scripts ex2.m and ex2reg.m set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions in the files listed above.

## Motivation
This is a great reference for good practices and what's "under the hood" in regularized logistic regression.
